I"ð<p>I needed to better keep track of my investments while not having to constantly check them everyday. There is plenty of subscriptions services that does that but I wanted to learn some python so here is the perfect excuse to try to build one.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-prerequisites">Setting up the prerequisites</h4>
<p>You need an Alpha Vantage account at <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co">alphavantage.co</a> and generate an api key or #####AV_API_KEY#####, itâ€™s free. Also you need to install Pushover on your device (iPhone / android / Desktop) at <a href="https://pushover.net">pushover.net</a>. On their website you will need to note your User key or #####PUSHOVER_CLIENT_TOKEN##### and create an application to generate an api key or #####PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN#####.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="my-code">My code:</h4>

<pre><code class="language-Python">import pandas as pd #Data manipulation and analysis package
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries #Enables data pull from Alpha Vantage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #If you want to plot your findings
import time
from pushover import Client #Enables you to push notifications to your phone

symbol = "AAPL"
target_sell_price = 230 #enter the price you want to sell at
target_buy_price = 128 #enter the price you want to buy at

#Getting the data from alpha_vantage
ts = TimeSeries(key='#####AV_API_KEY#####', output_format='pandas')
data, meta_data = ts.get_intraday(symbol,interval='5min', outputsize='full')

#We are currently interested in the latest price
close_data = data['4. close'] #The close data column
last_price = close_data[0] #Selecting the last price from the close_data column

client = Client("#####PUSHOVER_CLIENT_TOKEN#####", api_token="#####PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN#####")#auth with pushover



if last_price &gt; target_sell_price:
    message = str(symbol) + " STOCK ALERT!!! The stock is now above $" + format(target_sell_price, '.2f') + " it's at $" + format(last_price, '.2f')#The message you want to send
    client.send_message(message, title="Stock Price Alert")

if last_price &lt;= target_buy_price:
    message = str(symbol) + " STOCK ALERT!!! The stock is now under $" + format(target_buy_price, '.2f') + " it's at $" + format(last_price, '.2f')#The message you want to send
    client.send_message(message, title="Stock Price Alert")
