I"b<p>I needed to keep track of my investments while not having to constantly check them everyday. There is plenty of subscription services that does that but I wanted to learn some python so I got the perfect excuse to try and build one. I will start with a Raspberry pi as the base to serve that service since it will always be running on my network.</p>
