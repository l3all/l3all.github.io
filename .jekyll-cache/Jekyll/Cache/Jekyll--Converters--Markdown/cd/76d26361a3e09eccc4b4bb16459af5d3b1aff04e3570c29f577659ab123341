I"Â<p>I just wanted to document the creation process of creating this website. The goal of this site is to share what I do with you. I will be promoting my woodworking projects and everything I deem showable of the free time stuff going on here.</p>

<p>So I needed a simple vessel to present that. Here we are with the technicals:</p>

<h4 id="installing-brew">Installing brew</h4>
<p>Brew is a package manager for macOS. It is immensly useful to install things and keep them up to date. <a href="https://brew.sh">brew.sh</a></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xcode-select --install
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"   Enter your macOS password
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="installing-ruby">Installing ruby</h4>
<p>macOS uses an old version of ruby by default and itâ€™s increasingly hard to update it with the latest updates because you encounter permission errors so the best way to go around this problem is installing a virtual environment to then install a version of ruby inside like rbenv or RVM or you can install a ruby changer for the whole system like chruby.
In my case I chose chruby and its friend ruby-install. Ruby-install will install from source any version of ruby so chruby can select the one to use system wide.</p>

<h5 id="in-the-terminal">In the terminalâ€¦</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install churby ruby-install -y
chruby -V   #To see if it's installed properly
ruby-install ruby 2.7.2   #Will install ruby 2.7.2 from source
</code></pre></div></div>
