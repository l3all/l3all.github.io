I"ñ<p>I needed to better keep track of my investments while not having to constantly check them everyday. There is plenty of subscriptions services that does that but I wanted to learn some python so here is the perfect excuse to try to build one. A Raspberry pi is a good option for that service since it will always run on my server. In this series I will start from the beginnings to a working notification system that works well. I also expect the functionality to evolve trough the process.</p>
