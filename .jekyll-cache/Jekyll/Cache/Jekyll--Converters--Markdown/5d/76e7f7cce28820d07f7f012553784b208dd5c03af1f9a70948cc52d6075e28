<pre><code class="language-Python">import pandas as pd #Data manipulation and analysis package
from alpha_vantage.timeseries import TimeSeries #Enables data pull from Alpha Vantage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #If you want to plot your findings

symbol = "AAPL"
target_sell_price = 230 #enter the price you want to sell at
target_buy_price = 128 #enter the price you want to buy at

#Getting the data from alpha_vantage
ts = TimeSeries(key='#####KEY#####', output_format='pandas')
data, meta_data = ts.get_intraday(symbol,interval='5min', outputsize='full')

#We are currently interested in the latest price
close_data = data['4. close'] #The close data column
last_price = close_data[0] #Selecting the last price from the close_data column

client = Client("#####CLIENT_TOKEN#####", api_token="#####API_TOKEN#####")#auth with pushover



if last_price &gt; target_sell_price:
    message = str(symbol) + " STOCK ALERT!!! The stock is now above $" + format(target_sell_price, '.2f') + " it's at $" + format(last_price, '.2f')#The message you want to send
    client.send_message(message, title="Stock Price Alert")
